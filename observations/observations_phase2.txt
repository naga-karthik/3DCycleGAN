Information regarding the new files created, changes made and experiments performed

DATASET: A new dataset has been created, with new augmentation methods - (i) elastic deformation and (ii) contrast stretching, on top of the existing, random rotation and white noise addition.
	MRI training data - 1214 volumes	MRI testing data - 15 volumes
	CT training data - 200 volumes		

Observations:
1) torch.nn.DataParallel is not working as expected because there is a huge imbalance in GPU memory consumption. Only one GPU uses all the memory and increasing batch size causes out-of-memory error.	(Solution: torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel)
2) The distributed package works well to avoid the memory imbalance problem. On initial testing, it was observed that when running on 2 GPUs, both their memories were being used equally. 


Experiments to run:
1) Vanilla CycleGAN3D model with Adversarial, Cycle-consisteny, and Identity losses for 250 epochs
2) CycleGAN3D with perceptual loss and the remaining standard losses. (works only on Cedar's GPUs because it consumes about 30GB memory on both GPUs)
