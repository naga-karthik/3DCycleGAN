Documenting all the changes made to the new dataset

MRI: 
1) The rotations are kept as it is i.e. the same data is copied from the old version of the dataset.
2) Gaussian noise addition is changed: mean and std are now fixed -> mean = 0 and std = 0.01
3) Elastic deformation is used a new data augmentation method. This was originally used in 2D and 3D Unet papers. For each original volume, 10 volumes are deformed with a constant voxel grid size of 3x3x3 with std=4, and 5 volumes with voxel grid of size 5x5x5 with std=4.
4) The volumes have now also been constrast stretched (a type of normalization, but "less harsh" than histogram equalization)

CT: 
Exactly same as the steps which have been followed for MRI images
Original -> 4 volumes
Rotations -> 10 rotations each = 40 volumes
Noise addition -> 10 each = 40
Elastic deformation -> 15 deformations each = 60 volumes
Contrast strectching -> 15 volumes chosen at random for each volume = 60 
Therefore, the total size of the CT dataset -> 4 + 40 + 40 + 60 + 60 = 204


-> CHANGELOG 19/6/20

A few changes made to the test dataset (folder A). The test images from MICCAI were flipped so that the spinous process and the laminae are to the left of the screen (earlier they were facing right). This was done using np.flip(volume, axis=1). 3 test images from Scoliotic were also flipped vertically using np.flip(volume). 

-> WHY? It was observed that when the test images are generated, the model only seems to have learnt translation in one particular orientation of the vertebral body and the spinous processes (that is, when the body is on the right and the spinous processes/laminae are on the left). Doing this slight modification improved some results on the translated CT domain.
